🧠 THE CORE PRINCIPLE

**Backend expands. Frontend contracts.

Brain stays complex. UI stays simple.
All updates must preserve and expand logic — never replace or remove value.**

🌟 THE NEW ULTRA-SIMPLE FRONTEND SYSTEM (4 PAGES TOTAL)

**All previous pages are collapsed into these.

No engine is removed.
Only the UI is simplified.**
