# A8 Engine Status — UNSAFE → SAFE Rescue

This file is generated by the A8 SAFE rescue step.

- SAFE: file exists and contains no suspect network / FMP patterns.
- SAFE_STUB_CREATED: file did not exist; A8 created a neutral SAFE stub.
- POSSIBLY_UNSAFE: file exists but references network / FMP / axios etc. (not wired automatically).
- MISSING: no file found and no stub created (should not happen if A8 is working correctly).
